This is Vera Rilossi, I recently graduated in Computer Programming and Design, magna cum laude in New York City. <br><br> During college, I held an internship as a front-end web developer and graphic designer for a company in the education industry. I was awarded a scholarship for my academic performance and I was also part of the Phi Theta Kappa honors society. <br><br>I like to always push myself to ensure that my designs are the best I could possibly make with my current skillset. I never want to stop leaning and growing. <br><br>When I'm not coding or designing, I like to cook and play videogames. <br><br>I've coded this responsive portfolio using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br><br> Thank you for visiting :)<br><br>
